Jensen Huang: State-by-state AI regulation would drag industry to a halt. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said he met with President Donald Trump on Wednesday and that the two men discussed chip export restrictions, as lawmakers consider a proposal to limit exports of advanced artificial intelligence chips to nations like China. Lawmakers were considering including the Guaranteeing Access and Innovation for National Artificial Intelligence Act in a major defense package, known as the National Defense Authorization Act. The GAIN AI Act would require chipmakers like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices to give U.S. companies first pick on their AI chips before selling them in countries like China. "State-by-state AI regulation would drag this industry into a halt and it would create a national security concern, as we need to make sure that the United States advances AI technology as quickly as possible," Huang said.</td>

Speculation that Nvidia's dominance in the AI market may be threatened isn't new. The analysts are convinced that even as competition in the AI chip market intensifies, Nvidia will still maintain the best performance-to-cost ratio and be able to access a wider range of AI applications and workloads than its competitors. ### Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know</td>

For perspective, Wall Street’s consensus on Nvidia stock sits at **an average $250.66 price target**, which implies nearly a 38% upside from current levels. * **Goldman Sachs & JPMorgan** both lifted their 12-month Nvidia targets to around **$250**, on the back of still-surging AI infrastructure demand and healthy data-center visibility. ## **Why Nvidia still owns the AI chip market**. On top of that, broader industry syntheses still put Nvidia’s market share somewhere between **80% to 95%** of the total AI-accelerator market and nearly **92%** of data-center GPU share.

But the company also maintains a broad software research arm that releases open-source AI code that others, such as Palantir Technologies, can adopt. On Monday, Nvidia released Alpamayo-R1 for self-driving vehicles. Most previous self-driving car software was limited in how it explained why the car chose a particular path, making it hard for engineers to understand what needed to be fixed to make the cars safer. * TechnologycategoryNvidia releases open-source software for self-driving car development</td>
