## Nvidia stock is down form its recent upswing, but it is still holding strong and proving the AI market is healthy.

Nvidia stock has not retained all of its most recent gains.

#### Quick overview

## On Tuesday, Nvidia (NVDA) stock shot up from $179 per share to $185- a gain of 3.3%, which was quickly followed on Wednesday with a drop of 0.48%. [...] Recently Nvidia released its third quarter financial report, and they beat Wall Street predictions and forecasted a strong coming quarter. That caused their stock to rise by 2.1%, but Nvidia has had more than a dozen stock increases larger than that over the past year. [...] Despite tremendous growth already this year, Nvidia still has excellent stock growth potential.

Nvidia has held onto only some of its gains from its recent surge, and the company’s stock prices remain volatile in a market that is not sure what the future of artificial intelligence holds for businesses that are heavily invested in it.</td>
