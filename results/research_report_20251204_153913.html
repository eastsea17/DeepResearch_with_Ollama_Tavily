Co-processing of biogenic or waste-derived oils in existing refining assets is a pathway for refiners to introduce renewable and/or circular carbon into their finished products to meet mandates and/or improve margins through incentives. The refiner must also consider RIN credits received for co-processing and the impact that will occur in their process unit from the various co-feed options and integration strategies. The starting biomass and process technologies can have a significant impact on the total carbon efficiency of a fuel production pathway, hence the RIN category and value. Co-processing of pyrolysis oils from waste plastics, in particular the heavy residual waxes from a pyrolysis process, is also a viable co-feed for the FCC unit. Under the current regulatory environment, which does not provide credits for co-processing of waste plastics to fuels, the FCC unit’s role in the circular economy will require effective carbon tracing from waste plastics to propylene, ethylene, and BTX.</td>

Lipid feedstocks, being constituted of triglycerides and free fatty acids, are suitable for direct FCC coprocessing given their good miscibility with vacuum gas oil (VGO) and overall cracking reactivity.8 Coprocessing of lipid feedstocks tends to increase conversion levels in FCC but typically yielding less fuel products.9−11 Pyrolysis bio-oils, the most studied form of bio-oil, are much more diﬃcult to deal with because of their elevated oxygen content (up to 40 wt Received: September 14, 2021 Revised: October 22, 2021 Article pubs.acs.org/EF Crown © XXXX.</td>

Specifically, camelina and safflower will be processed into low-carbon intensity oils and used as feedstock to produce hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), a fully compatible drop-in replacement for conventional diesel fuel or sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for the decarbonization of air travel. Intermediate novel crops expand the available pool of low-carbon intensity feedstocks to produce renewable fuel, with emission reductions of up to 90% compared to conventional diesel. “Renewable fuels are a fundamental pillar for Repsol on our road to becoming zero net emissions by 2050, and intermediate crops must play a key role in guaranteeing the supply of the low-carbon feedstocks necessary to produce these fuels.</td>

Developed Aspen-FCC model co-processing scenarios for bio-oil oxygenated-compounds/VGO. National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Petrobras have worked closely to develop process models and analysis approaches to assess the economic feasibility of co-processing bio-oils (pyrolysis oils) with fossil feedstocks in petroleum refinery unit operations. Petrobras conducted co-processing experiments with pine-derived bio-oils and Brazilian vacuum gasoil (VGO) at typical operating conditions on their 200 kg/h demonstration-scale fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) unit. Within the uncertainties of measurements and the simplified refinery models used, the process modeling and techno-economic analysis (TEA) results identify conditions in which co-processing bio-oils could be economically feasible for the case of refiners purchasing VGO, expanding prior work demonstrating technical feasibility. TEA scenarios show a high potential for bio-oil co-processing to be economically attractive for petroleum refiners for benchmark crude oil prices at $70 (U.S. dollars) per barrel using up to 5 wt% bio-oil produced with typical fast pyrolysis technology (≤400 t/d) fed with dried pine chips.</td>

To further reduce the carbon intensity of the FCC C₃= co-processing, some bio-derived feed streams to the FCC unit can be considered.³. It can be estimated that considering a co-processing rate of 10 wt% renewable feed with an oxygen content of about 10 wt% (in the range of many seed oils), the carbon intensity of the resulting C₃= would reduce by 9%. Increasing the combined FCC feed oxygen content by the co-processing of renewable feed streams like vegetable oils will increase the amount of these oxygenate species.</td>

One promising method for achieving this transformation is **co-processing WCO in the Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) unit**—an approach that leverages existing refinery assets and processes to fast-track the production of low-carbon intensity fuels and petrochemicals. An adsorbent like TRISYL® silica from Grace can help maximize the service life of catalysts by removing trace materials and impurities from difficult to refine feedstocks like waste cooking oil. For refineries equipped with FCC units, incorporating WCO into existing processes often requires minimal investment, making renewable fuel production more attractive. Co-processing renewable feedstocks like WCO not only helps refiners meet evolving regulatory standards but also unlocks premium market opportunities for low-carbon intensity products. Processing WCO through the FCC represents a remarkable step toward producing renewable fuels, paving the way for a more sustainable, circular economy.</td>

The carbon intensity of each fuel, from the bio-oil production in the pyrolysis process to its final consumption (Well-to-Wheel), was calculated using the GREET model (CA-GREET 2.0). This study aims to quantify the renewable-carbon content measured in the product samples obtained from co-processing vacuum gas oil with 5%, 10%, and 20% bio-oil in the FCC process using 14C isotopic analysis of the samples collected from a demonstration-scale FCC unit. The biogenic-carbon content of 40 product samples obtained from the co-processing of VGO and bio-oil (5 wt%, 10 wt%, and 20 wt%) in a demonstration-scale FCC unit was determined using 14C isotopic analysis.</td>

                        <td>While current market conditions for propylene are somewhat suppressed globally, there is a projected increase of 45 MM tpy in global demand for C₃= by 2030, which will drive the demand for fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) propylene accordingly.² Propylene produced by the FCC already has a favourable carbon intensity compared to other on-purpose processes.³ The application of ZSM-5-containing technology to improve FCC propylene yields is favoured due its neutral impact on the heat balance of FCC units and, therefore, Scope 1 emissions. To further reduce the carbon intensity of the FCC C₃= co-processing, some bio-derived feed streams to the FCC unit can be considered.³. It can be estimated that considering a co-processing rate of 10 wt% renewable feed with an oxygen content of about 10 wt% (in the range of many seed oils), the carbon intensity of the resulting C₃= would reduce by 9%. Increasing the combined FCC feed oxygen content by the co-processing of renewable feed streams like vegetable oils will increase the amount of these oxygenate species.</td>
